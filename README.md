# Brain Tumor Detection with VGG16

Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project, an effort utilizing the VGG16 model for the automatic detection and classification of brain tumors in medical images.

## Overview

This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically the VGG16 architecture, to assist in the early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors in medical images, such as MRI scans. It aims to provide an end-to-end solution for medical professionals and researchers interested in improving brain tumor detection.

## Key Features

- **VGG16 Model:** The project employs the VGG16 architecture as the backbone for feature extraction, harnessing its powerful learned representations.

- **Dataset:** A carefully curated and preprocessed dataset of brain MRI scans is used for training the model, ensuring data quality.

- **Data Augmentation:** Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase dataset diversity and improve model robustness.

- **Multi-Class Classification:** The model is trained to classify images into various brain tumor types (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors) and non-tumor cases.

- **Model Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves are used to assess model performance.

<!-- - **Visualization Tools:** Tools for visualizing model predictions and heatmaps are provided to aid in the interpretation of results.-->

<!--- **User-Friendly Interface:** An easy-to-use interface allows users to upload MRI scans for real-time tumor detection.-->

<!--## Usage

1. **Training:** To train the model on your dataset, follow the instructions in the provided `train.py` script. Make sure to replace the dataset with your own if necessary.

2. **Inference:** Use the trained model for inference by following the guidelines in `inference.py`. You can use this script to perform real-time tumor detection on new MRI scans.

3. **Visualization:** Explore the provided visualization tools to gain insights into model predictions and tumor localization.-->
